> An idea for a web application to track Rick and Morty characters and their relationships


## Application Idea

Create a web application that allows users to explore and track characters from the Rick and Morty series. The application will showcase the relationships between characters, locations, and episodes from the show. Users can query information about characters, locations, and episodes, but they can only edit character information.

### Key Features

1. **Character Database:** Users can browse through a database of Rick and Morty characters, view their details, and track their appearances in episodes and locations.

2. **Location Information:** The app provides information about different locations in the Rick and Morty multiverse, along with the list of residents living there.

3. **Episode Guide:** Users can access a guide to all episodes of the show, including air dates, names, and lists of characters who appear in each episode.

4. **Search and Filtering:** Implement a search and filter functionality that allows users to find specific characters, locations, or episodes based on various criteria like name, status, species, dimension, or air date.

5. **Character Tracking:** Users can create an account and track their favorite characters, keeping a list of episodes and locations where these characters appear.

6. **Character Editing:** Users with registered accounts can suggest edits or additions to character information. These suggestions can be reviewed by administrators before being applied.

7. **User Profiles:** Registered users can create and customize their profiles, showcasing their favorite characters and their viewing progress.

8. **API Integration:** Utilize the provided API for Rick and Morty data to fetch and update information.

### How it Works

Users can start by searching for characters, locations, or episodes. They can click on a character to see their details, such as name, species, status, and a list of episodes they appear in. Users can also explore the locations and episodes and view the relevant character and location data.

Registered users can create accounts to track characters and suggest edits to character information. Their progress and favorite characters will be saved in their profiles. Admins can review and approve character edits to maintain data accuracy.

This web application will serve as a hub for Rick and Morty fans to explore, track, and engage with the characters and their adventures in the show's multiverse.
